# Video-Audio Signal Processing

This is my implemention of the course project for **_Introduction to Auditory-visual Information System_**. I built three algorithms that solves the the following problems respectively:

1. Recognize faces from videos clips.
2. Recongizes voices from audios.
3. Given a video of three speakers speaking at the same time, separate the speeches from the three speakers.

This project is realized in Python with the aid of [Face Recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition), [Resemblyzer](https://github.com/resemble-ai/Resemblyzer) and [Speechbrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain).
